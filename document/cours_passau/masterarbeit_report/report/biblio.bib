	abstract = {Digital forensics is the process of extracting, preserving, and documenting evidence in digital devices. A commonly used method in digital forensics is to extract data from the main memory of a digital device. However, the main challenge is identifying the important data to be extracted. Several pieces of crucial information reside in the main memory, like usernames, passwords, and cryptographic keys such as {SSH} session keys. In this paper, we propose {SmartKex}, a machine-learning assisted method to extract session keys from heap memory snapshots of an {OpenSSH} process. In addition, we release an openly available dataset and the corresponding toolchain for creating additional data. Finally, we compare {SmartKex} with naive brute-force methods and empirically show that {SmartKex} can extract the session keys with high accuracy and high throughput. With the provided resources, we intend to strengthen the research on the intersection between digital forensics, cybersecurity, and machine learning.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, many users are using an encrypted channel to communicate with a remote resource server. Such a channel provides a high degree of privacy and conﬁdentiality. Secure Shell ({SSH}) is one of the most commonly used methods to connect to a server remotely. {SSH} provides privacy and conﬁdentiality by encrypting network trafﬁc between the client and the server. The encryption makes the learning process of malicious activities over {SSH} is challenging, especially by just analyzing the network trafﬁc. To overcome the problem, we can leverage Virtual machine introspection ({VMI}). {VMI} allows direct memory access of a virtual machine ({VM}) including accessing data of an {SSH} process. However, the current prototype suffers from high overhead since it extracts every single plain text {SSH} network payload from memory and the extraction process requires the virtual machine ({VM}) to be momentarily paused. In this paper, we introduce {SSHkex}, a tool that also leverages {VMI} to extracts {SSH}'s session keys from a server's memory. Our approach only needs to pause the {VM} twice to extract the session keys for each {SSH} session and does passive network monitoring where does not have any noticeable impact on the ongoing connection. To use {SSHkex}, zero modiﬁcation needs to be done to the server. Thus, it is suitable for intrusion detection systems and high-interaction honeypot where the server shall not be modiﬁed.},
