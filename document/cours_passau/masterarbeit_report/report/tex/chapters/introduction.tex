\paragraph*{}Digital forensics is a linchpin in cybersecurity, enabling the extraction of vital evidence from devices like PCs. This evidence is key for detecting malware and tracing intruder activities. Analyzing a device's main memory is a go-to technique in this field. The fusion of machine learning promises to amplify and streamline these analyses.

\paragraph*{}With the rising need for encrypted communication, Secure Shell (\acrshort{ssh}) protocols are now commonplace. However, these security-focused channels can inadvertently shield malicious actions, posing challenges to standard investigative approaches. Cutting-edge research offers solutions. The work in \citetitle*{fellicious_smartkex_2022}~\cite*{fellicious_smartkex_2022} highlights how machine learning can boost the extraction of session keys from OpenSSH memory images. In a complementary vein, \citetitle*{sentanoe_sshkex_2022}~\cite*{sentanoe_sshkex_2022} showcases the power of Virtual Machine Introspection (\acrshort{vmi}) for direct SSH key extraction.

\paragraph*{}Inspired by \citetitle*{fellicious_smartkex_2022}, this thesis zeroes in on a central challenge: data embedding. While previous studies set the stage for key extraction, the data embedding technique, especially windowing, can be optimized. The design of data embeddings is pivotal for machine learning efficacy, especially in nuanced tasks like memory analysis. This research introduces fresh embedding strategies, aiming to refine extraction and unearth deeper memory snapshot patterns. Merging graph embeddings with advanced machine learning, the goal is to craft a sophisticated toolkit for OpenSSH heap dump studies, bridging digital forensics and machine learning.
