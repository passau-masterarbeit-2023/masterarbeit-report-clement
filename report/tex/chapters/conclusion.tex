\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

\paragraph{}In conclusion, this Master's thesis has provided a comprehensive survey of various embedding techniques for the classification of SSH keys in OpenSSH memory dumps. The study has uncovered that simple embedding techniques, such as the trim method and statistical approaches, yield highly effective results when applied to this specific dataset. Additionally, NLP techniques like Word2Vec and Transformers have shown promising outcomes, although they require further refinement through hyperparameter tuning to reach their full potential.

\paragraph{}While coherence testing has not been conclusively demonstrated, the classification results have been exceptionally positive, indicating the practical value of the research. However, there remains a substantial scope for future work. This includes measuring the time efficiency of the embedding processes, extensive hyperparameter optimization, exploration of additional NLP techniques, and more rigorous coherence testing. These areas present exciting opportunities for further research and development in the field of digital forensics and cybersecurity.
