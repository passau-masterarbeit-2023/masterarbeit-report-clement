    \paragraph{}This research dives into the complexities of embedding byte sequences, focusing particularly on the extraction of structures containing SSH keys for machine learning purposes. The varied uses of OpenSSH introduce distinct challenges due to potential variations in the created embeddings. Given the wide array of SSH key dimensions and OpenSSH's intricate operations, maintaining the embeddings' stability and consistency is vital. In this methodological section, we will detail various embedding methods, present a framework for their assessment through a classifier model, and suggest another strategy to verify the embeddings' coherence between the different OpenSSH usage and key sizes.
